# AI Enhancement - Comprehensive Text Scanning

## Overview
Enhanced the OpenAI Vision API prompt to perform comprehensive text scanning and business identification.

## What Changed (2025-10-30)

### Previous Behavior
- AI would look for obvious business information
- Sometimes missed business names that weren't prominently displayed
- Limited scanning of all visible text

### New Behavior
The AI now follows a 3-step process:

1. **SCAN ALL TEXT** - Reads every word visible in the image, including:
   - Signs and storefronts
   - Windows and doors
   - Vehicles and business cards
   - Building facades
   - Small text and fine print

2. **IDENTIFY BUSINESS NAMES** - Analyzes all found text to determine which represents:
   - Company names
   - Store names
   - Business branding
   - Business identifiers

3. **EXTRACT INFORMATION** - Pulls all available business details

### Enhanced JSON Response
The AI now returns additional data:

```json
{
  "all_text_found": ["every", "word", "seen", "in", "the", "image"],
  "business_name": "Identified business name",
  "business_type": "Type of business",
  "address": "Street address",
  "city": "City",
  "state": "State",
  "zip_code": "Zip code",
  "phone": "Phone number",
  "email": "Email",
  "website": "Website URL",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "notes": "Detailed explanation of how the business was identified"
}
```

### Key Improvements
- **More thorough**: Scans every visible word, even small text
- **Better accuracy**: Explicitly identifies which text is the business name
- **Transparency**: `all_text_found` array shows everything the AI detected
- **Context**: `notes` field explains how the business was identified
- **Higher token limit**: Increased from 1000 to 1500 tokens to accommodate more text

### Storage
All extracted data including `all_text_found` is stored in the `aiExtractionRaw` JSON field in the database, allowing you to review what text the AI saw in each image.

## Benefits
1. **Catches more businesses**: Won't miss business names on subtle signage
2. **Better for complex images**: Handles images with multiple text elements
3. **Debugging capability**: Can see exactly what text AI detected
4. **Improved confidence**: AI explains its reasoning in the notes

## File Modified
