# AI Enhancement - Comprehensive Text Scanning & Multi-Tenant Support

## Overview
Enhanced the OpenAI Vision API to perform comprehensive text scanning, business identification, and extract ALL businesses from multi-tenant buildings and directories.

## What Changed (2025-10-30)

### Multi-Tenant Building Support (Latest)

The system now extracts **ALL businesses** from multi-tenant buildings and directory signs!

**What happens now:**
- Upload a photo of a building directory (like the Chancellor Corporate Center example)
- AI scans and identifies ALL listed businesses
- Creates separate database records for each business
- Includes suite numbers, shared address, and building name
- Returns multiple business records from a single photo

**Example Output from Directory Photo:**
From the Chancellor Corporate Center directory image, the system will now extract:
- FROM HEALTH (Suite 101)
- COMPREHENSIVE THERAPY (Suite 105)
- INSIDE FAMILY CHIROPRACTIC (Suite 107)
- SAVIOR PHYSICAL THERAPY (Suite 201)
- VISTA PROPERTIES/SERVICES (Suite 206)
- MONUMENT MORTGAGE (Suite 207)
- GATEWAYLIFE INSURANCE (Suite 208, 210, 211)
- THE ARLINGTON AGENCY (Suite 209)
- And more...

**Each business gets:**
- Full address with suite number
- Building context (Chancellor Corporate Center)
- Shared phone/contact info
- Individual confidence scores
- Separate database record

### Comprehensive Text Scanning (Initial Feature)

### Previous Behavior
- AI would look for obvious business information
- Sometimes missed business names that weren't prominently displayed
- Limited scanning of all visible text

### New Behavior
The AI now follows a 3-step process:

1. **SCAN ALL TEXT** - Reads every word visible in the image, including:
   - Signs and storefronts
   - Windows and doors
   - Vehicles and business cards
   - Building facades
   - Small text and fine print

2. **IDENTIFY BUSINESS NAMES** - Analyzes all found text to determine which represents:
   - Company names
   - Store names
   - Business branding
   - Business identifiers

3. **EXTRACT INFORMATION** - Pulls all available business details

### Enhanced JSON Response
The AI now returns additional data:

```json
{
  "all_text_found": ["every", "word", "seen", "in", "the", "image"],
  "business_name": "Identified business name",
  "business_type": "Type of business",
  "address": "Street address",
  "city": "City",
  "state": "State",
  "zip_code": "Zip code",
  "phone": "Phone number",
  "email": "Email",
  "website": "Website URL",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "notes": "Detailed explanation of how the business was identified"
}
```

### Key Improvements
- **More thorough**: Scans every visible word, even small text
- **Better accuracy**: Explicitly identifies which text is the business name
- **Transparency**: `all_text_found` array shows everything the AI detected
- **Context**: `notes` field explains how the business was identified
- **Higher token limit**: Increased from 1000 to 1500 tokens to accommodate more text

### Storage
All extracted data including `all_text_found` is stored in the `aiExtractionRaw` JSON field in the database, allowing you to review what text the AI saw in each image.

## Benefits
1. **Catches more businesses**: Won't miss business names on subtle signage
2. **Better for complex images**: Handles images with multiple text elements
3. **Debugging capability**: Can see exactly what text AI detected
4. **Improved confidence**: AI explains its reasoning in the notes
